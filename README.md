# ESP32-Double_Helix_Desk_Lamp
<br/>
This was a passion project for a friend who is studying for their PHD in bioinformatics and genomic research.
<br/>

The video quality isn't great but this is a 3D printed double helix (DNA structure) desk lamp that runs an ESP-32 which hosts its own network access point that has a webserver running on it. This allows the user to connect to the device and change the colors, speed, brightness, pattern, and more all from their phone or computer.
